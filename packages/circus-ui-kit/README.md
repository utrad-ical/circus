# CIRCUS UI Kit

This is a part of CIRCUS Project.

This package contains the following:

- Generic React UI components that works with CIRCUS Web UI
- `ImageViewer` component, a React binding for CIRCUS CS `Viewer` which let you display viewers (almost) declaratively

The primary purpose for using this package is to build your own "Display" to customize CIRCUS CS results screen. But `ImageViewer` is useful on its own.

# Usage

```bash
npm install @utrad-ical/circus-ui-kit
```
